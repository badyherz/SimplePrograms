# SimplePrograms
A Growing Collection of Random Tools and Programs.

This collection includes just some simple helpful programs.
They exist either because I don't want to use online services or couldn't find anything that is simple enough.

All of them are created with the help of chatGPT and all written in Python because I'm not great at coding at all.

I will add more when I create more. And I only make them when I need them.
I'm sharing these here because maybe someone finds them as helpful as I do.

Just download what you want from the newest [release](https://github.com/badyherz/SimplePrograms/releases)!

## Below is a list of the programs:

**Bulk File Renamer for Series**

This was created for renaming series for home media use, because who wants to rename 30 files or so?
Can be useful for general renaming too.

.

**EXE File Search**

This lets you search for .EXE files in folders and sort them. Created because I wanted to find a specific old hidden program.

.

**GIF to PNG Converter**

With this you can extract all the frames of a .GIF and save them in a folder to .PNG.
Used for creating manual gifs.

.

**HEX Encoder and Decoder**

Well. You can Encode and Decode Hexadecimal Code. Used for hidden messages in games.

.

**Text Comparator**

This can compare to strings of text for you and highlights the difference.
I used it to compare hash codes.
